# LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This repository serves as a personal archive of the problems I’ve solved on LeetCode, and I hope it can also be a valuable resource for others tackling these challenges.

## Purpose
- **Personal Record:** To track my progress and solutions as I continue to solve various coding problems on LeetCode.
- **Resource for Others:** To provide guidance and reference for anyone seeking help with similar problems. Each solution is accompanied by explanations and comments to make understanding easier.

## Structure
- **Problem Categories:** The problems are organized by category (e.g., arrays, strings, matrix, etc.) to make navigation easier.
- **Languages:** Solutions are primarily written in C++. I may add more languages as I continue to explore different solutions.

## Contributions
If you have alternative solutions or improvements, feel free to open a pull request or issue. Collaboration is welcome!

## Contact
